#Patent Changes
===============

To improve on this patent we are going to make the patent more specific and add some details about its usage.

##Details
The system will be made specific to a theme park. It will be used to help with statistica analysis of the park occupancy. It can also be used to provide real-time location feedback to help locate missing persons.

##Additions
To help improve the imaging systems, [Lidar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar) will be added to provide visual representations of the park. 

We can also use the locations provided by the RF-ID and cross reference them with the locations of objects moving in the park to determine if there are any intruders in the area.
