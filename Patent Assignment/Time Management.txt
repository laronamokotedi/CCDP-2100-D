Time Management


This part needs to be done as team:

How many person-hours do you estimate the planning-to-presentation of this componentâ€™s design will take?  What R&D stages would you consider?  The purpose of this part of the exercise is to ensure that all team members are aware and agree on the number of hours required for the design of this


If everyone can put in what they think it will take only them to do each stage then we can tally it up and get the totals.
