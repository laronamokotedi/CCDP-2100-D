#Principles and Theorems
=========================

##Overview

Each Team-Member of your particular Patent-Project will need to research, determine and state 2 engineering principles that apply to a well-identified aspect of your Team’s Patent Project.  Each principle should be referenced by two sources and these references should be written in (in [IEEE Format](http://www.ieee.org/documents/ieeecitationref.pdf)).  All told, a Patent-Team of 4 will provide 8 different engineering principles with 16 reference sources.  A reference can be a course textbook, engineering handbook, journal article, etc.  While Wikipedia can be an initial source of information, it should not be used as a reference on its own. However, its own peer-reviewed and recognized references can be used as your referenced sources of information.

This will ensure that you become more familiar with researching engineering principals, theorems or laws in [Carleton’s Library Catalogue](http://catalogue.library.carleton.ca/) or in its extensive collection of electronic journals via [Carleton’s Library Journals](http://www.library.carleton.ca/find/journal-articles).  These engineering concepts must support your project patent of this term which is focused on improving the safety and energy-efficiency of automobiles.

(This Part should be discussed as a team to ensure that each teammate will explain two different principles. Teammate feedback on the individual’s work is encouraged as is other classmates’ feedback)


Each team member needs to explain their 2 different principles (in ~400 words or less).  

Specify below the Engineering Principles, Theorems or Laws that apply to your team’s patent project, also indicate in which course it was introduced to you.  If it is to be presented in a future course, indicate this with “TBL” (To Be Learned) along with the course ID.
